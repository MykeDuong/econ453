## A. Using the data for both schools for both years, calculate a 95% 
## confidence interval for overall average test score.

# number of rows and degree of freedom
n <- nrow(score_data)
df <- (n - 1)

# Manual way of calculating
# mean(score_data$score) + (sd(score_data$score) /sqrt(n)) * qt(0.025, df)
# mean(score_data$score) + (sd(score_data$score) /sqrt(n)) * qt(0.975, df)

t.test(score_data$score,conf.level = 0.95)

## B. Test the null hypothesis that overall average test scores (for both 
## schoolsand for both years combined) is 63 against the alternative that the 
## average is not 63. Use 5% level of significance.


t.test(score_data$score, mu = 63, conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided")

# p-value = 0.7034 > 5% => fail to reject the null hypothesis that overall 
# average test scores (for both schools and for both years combined) is 63 


## C. The School District, which encompasses both schools, claims that average 
## test score increased for both schools between 2014 and 2016. Does the data 
## support the School Districtâ€™s claim? Verify the claim one school at a time.

## D. A county official claims that performance of fourth graders does not 
## differ between both schools. Does the data support the claim? Verify the
## claim for 2014 and 2016 separately.

t.test(lincoln_2014, kennedy_2014, conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided")

## E: A score of 40 is considered as pass. Test the hypothesis that the 
## proportion of students who pass the exam is the same for both schools 
## against the alternative that the proportions are not the same.

# Define and create pass/fail data
score_data$pass = ifelse((score_data$score >= 40), 1, 0)

kennedy_pass = score_data$pass[score_data$school == 'Kennedy']
lincoln_pass = score_data$pass[score_data$school == 'Lincoln']

t.test(kennedy_pass, lincoln_pass, conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided")
# p-value= 0.0003 < 5% => reject the null hypothesis that proportion of students 
# who pass the exam is the same for both schools.

t.test(kennedy_pass, lincoln_pass, conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "greater")
# # p-value= 0.0001 < 5% => reject the null hypothesis and accept the
# alternative hypothesis that the Kennedy school had a larger proportion
# of students passing the exam, with a confidence level of 95%
